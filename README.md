# Hashira Placements Assignment â€“ Shamir Secret Sharing

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement
This project implements a simplified **Shamir Secret Sharing** scheme to:
1. Read input shares (points) from a JSON file.
2. Convert numbers from arbitrary bases into decimal.
3. Use Lagrange interpolation to reconstruct the **secret key**.
4. Verify all provided shares and **identify corrupted points** (if any).
5. Print both the secret and the wrong data points.

The assignment restricts solutions to **C++** (no Python, no external libraries).
